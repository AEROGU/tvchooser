## Features
- Navigate through directories
- Select files and directories
- Windows support

## Usage

To add this package to your project:

```
go get github.com/aerogu/tvchooser
```

Get the library and call FileChooser or DirectoryChooser passing your tview `app` as parameter to pause it while the chooser interface is in use, or pass `nil` if you are building a non GUI console application but want the user to select a file or directory at some point.

## Hello World

Simple file chooser, English is the default language.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/aerogu/tvchooser"
)

func main() {
	path := tvchooser.FileChooser(nil)
	fmt.Print("RUTA: " + path)
}
```

Spanish language is included too, but you can set your own language by filling your own `tvclang.Texts` object and set it with `tvclang.SetTranslations(yourTranslations)`

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/aerogu/tvchooser"
	"github.com/aerogu/tvchooser/tvclang"
)

func main() {
	tvclang.SetTranslations(tvclang.LangSpanish())
	path := tvchooser.FileChooser(nil)

	fmt.Print("RUTA: " + path)
}
```
